# DSP-Project-Noise-Filtering-of-Input-Signal

The project performs signal processing tasks on an input signal: it plots the signal and its zoomed portion, computes and visualizes its frequency response, identifies peaks, designs a digital filter, applies the filter to the signal, and produces a thresholded binary output. Poles and zeros of the filter are plotted, and timing details are provided. The code showcases steps from signal visualization to advanced processing, offering insights into frequency analysis, filtering, and binary signal generation.
